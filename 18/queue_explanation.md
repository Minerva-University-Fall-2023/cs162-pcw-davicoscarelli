# Queue Explanations

## Queue: The Grocery Store Line
- `Queue` is like the standard line at the grocery store. First come, first served, no cutting, and definitely no bribing the cashier.

## PriorityQueue: The VIP Line
- `PriorityQueue` is for the VIPs, the ones who wear sunglasses indoors and skip the line because their time is apparently more valuable.

## LifoQueue: The Forgetful One
- `LifoQueue` is that one friend who always forgets what they were about to say. It's all about the last thing you remembered.

## Commonalities
- They all inherit from the `Queue` class because, let's face it, who wants to write more code than necessary?
- Basic methods like `put()`, `get()`, `task_done()`, and `join()` are the bread and butter here. They're like the family traditions that just keep going, no matter how outdated they get.

## The Magic Methods
- `_init()`: Where the type of queue is born. It's like choosing the theme for your birthday party.
- `_qsize()`: Checking the size of the queue, because knowing how many people are ahead of you in line is a matter of life and death.
- `_put()`: Adding to the queue. It's like adding another item to your already too long to-do list.
- `_get()`: Taking from the queue. It's like finally crossing off that to-do list item you've been avoiding.

## PriorityQueue: Sorting Like a Boss
- `PriorityQueue` uses a heap because sorting items by priority is for the cool kids. It's like having a bouncer at the club who only lets in the 'important' people.

## LifoQueue: Last In, First Out
- `LifoQueue` is the rebel without a cause. It's a stack, so the last one in is the first one out, like a pop song that's only cool for about five minutes.
